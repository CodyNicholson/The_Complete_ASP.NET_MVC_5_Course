# Building A Feature End-To-End Systematically

In this section we will go over a systematic approach to build any features or an internal application end to end. In this section we will add the ability to record rentals.

We will build a page where the user can look up a customer and the movies they're going to rent. When they submit the form we'll display a toast notification and clear the form so they can add more rentals.
